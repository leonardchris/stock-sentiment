# stock-sentiment
A project to examine the utility of incorporating Twitter sentiment data into stock market movement prediction.

The stock market is a volatile landscape that nonetheless demands even more sophisticated levels of understanding and prediction. Through the last decades, increasingly nuanced approaches to forecasting stock market movement have been developed, with the ultimate goal of price prediction.
In a purely financial world, monitoring solely the financial data may be a viable approach to predicting how a stock will perform. We cannot, however, section away the very real human aspect of stock trading. This is a complicating, chaotic factor. To account for this, I developed a modeling paradigm to include human data, collected from Twitter, to monitor how human sentiment changes about our stocks over time.

The 'Project Summary' pdf is a multi-page description of the motivation for the work, how I cleaned the data and performed my analyses. I also discuss some of the results of this project.

Tl;dr: if you have a lot of sentiment data for the stock you're interested in, it may be a useful addition to your model.


The code for this project was designed and executed in annotated iPython notebooks. The 'Final Notebook.ipynb' file contains the primary analyses, but various data cleaning and processing tasks were performed using scripts in the 'Scripts' directory.

I've recorded a brief walkthrough of the Final Notebook script and posted this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai501F49Pck&feature=youtu.be

The 'Graphs' directory contains relevant graphs of the data.

'Raw data' contains the data sets before cleaning and integration, and the 'org_data' folder contains the final datasets used for the analyses.

Please email me if you have questions, ideas, concerns, quibbles, or lasagna.
